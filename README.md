COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data to understand the impact of the pandemic across different regions, countries, and continents. The analysis includes examining total cases, total deaths, infection rates, and death percentages over time.

The project utilizes data from multiple sources, processed to create meaningful insights for visualizations. These insights can be used to observe trends, compare regions, and visualize the spread of COVID-19 across different countries.

Key Focus Areas:
Total COVID-19 Cases and Deaths:

Analyzed the total number of new cases and deaths globally.
Calculated the death percentage by dividing new deaths by new cases and multiplying by 100.
COVID-19 Death Count by Continent:

Summarized the total death count by continent, excluding certain areas like 'World' and 'European Union'.
Sorted and compared the death counts across regions.
Infection Rates by Location:

Identified locations with the highest infection counts.
Calculated the percent of the population infected for each region using the formula: (total cases/population) * 100.
Infection Rates Over Time by Location:

Analyzed the evolution of infection rates over time for each location.
This step examined how infection counts changed day-by-day across different regions.
Files in the Project:
SQL Queries: The attached SQL queries process and aggregate the data to generate insights for the visualizations.

Excel Files: Data files used in the analysis are provided. These files include COVID-19 case and death data, as well as population information for various regions and countries.

How to Use the Files:
Run the SQL Queries:

The provided SQL queries should be run against a database containing the COVID-19 data.
These queries will calculate the necessary totals, death percentages, and infection rates.
Use the Excel Files:

The Excel files contain the raw data used in the queries.
They should be loaded into the database to be used in the analysis or can be imported directly into Tableau for visualization.
Visualizations:

Import the processed data into Tableau or any other data visualization tool to generate graphs, charts, and insights.
The visualizations will help track the spread of COVID-19, analyze infection rates, and compare death percentages across different regions.
